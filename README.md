Jupyter Notebook

CSV file handling

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

EDA & Visualization

📁 Data Source

Cyclistic’s 12-month ride data, split into 4 quarterly CSV files from the year 2019.

🛠️ Process Overview

Data Cleaning: Standardized mismatched column names across quarters.

Merging: Combined all quarters into one complete dataset.

Feature Engineering: Extracted trip duration, ride hour, day, month, etc.
